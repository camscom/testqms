## Introduction

Functional testing is a crucial aspect of software testing that ensures an application performs as expected according to its functional requirements. It verifies that each feature of the software operates in conformance with the required specifications. This type of testing mainly involves black-box testing, where the tester is unaware of the internal workings of the system.

## What is Functional Testing?
Functional testing validates the behavior of the software by focusing on its functionality rather than its internal logic or structure. It checks whether the application is doing what it is supposed to do by providing input and verifying the output against expected results.

## Key points about functional testing:

- It tests user interactions and the system's response.
- It validates business requirements.
- It is conducted from an end-user perspective.
- It involves black-box testing techniques, meaning the testers are unaware of how the application is built or structured.

## Main Types of Functional Testing
Functional testing can be categorized into several types based on the purpose and scope of testing. Here are the main types along with the job roles typically responsible for each:

### 1. Unit Testing
- Purpose: Tests individual units or components of a software application.
- Focus: Validates the functionality of a specific section of code, typically at the function or method level.
- Job Role: Software Developers or Software Engineers
- Example: Testing a calculator app's addition method to ensure it returns the correct sum.

### 2. Integration Testing
- Purpose: Tests the interactions between integrated units or components.
- Focus: Ensures that combined components work together as expected.
- Job Role: Software Developers, Integration Testers, or QA Engineers
- Example: Verifying data flow between a frontend form and the backend database.

### 3. System Testing
- Purpose: Evaluates the complete and integrated software system.
